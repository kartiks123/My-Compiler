# My-Compiler
This is my compiler which can perform the following operations:-

1) Tokenization; wherein we can break a sequence of strings into different pieces such as keywords, symbols, etc., which helps in the process of Lexical Analysis.
2) Parsing; it is used to break data into small elements. It takes input in the form of sequence of tokens and produces output in the form of parse tree.
3) Binary file; it is a file whose content is in a binary format, consisting of a series of sequential bytes.
